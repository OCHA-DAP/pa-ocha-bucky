Data Protection and Responsible Data Management
The data to be transferred will be of ‘low or no’ sensitivity, meaning that if disclosed or accessed without proper authorization, it is unlikely to cause any harm or negative impacts to affected people and/or humanitarian actors. This means the data can be shared publicly. 
For the purposes of these Terms, Responsible Data Management entails adherence to a set of principles, processes and tools that support the safe, ethical and effective management of data in humanitarian response. This includes upholding high standards for data protection, privacy, and security.
In cases where the Data is found to be of a higher level of sensitivity than ‘low or no’ as specified above, you should take all the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect the data against accidental, or unauthorized destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized access, use, alteration or dissemination, and against all other unauthorized forms of processing.
Such measures may include selecting a secure tool or method for transfer, removal of unnecessary sensitive data, secure storage options, limiting access to the data before, during and after transfer, and/or stipulating a shorter term for retention of the Data.
